### Hi there, I'm Magda!
### I'm preparing static resume page https://paxnamra.github.io/ so if it happens you are a recruiter, you will know what to do :)

- :cloud: I'm keen on cloud computing technologies. Mostly AWS cloud provider but I'm growing interest in GCP as well 
- :coffee: I know Java and a bit of its frameworks like Spring and Hibernate
- :sparkles: I highly value knowledge sharing, ability to explain things to others, feedback culture allowing to improve skills and open communication 

- :comet: I'm currently learning javascript to make it do cool things in the cloud! 
- :star: If not doing any of mentioned above I'm discovering amazing world of functional programming, probably with javascript and Ramda library or Scala
- :smiling_imp: One day I'm going to be awsome developer. Just hold my alcohol-free beer and watch!

### Current list of projects:
* static page - (html, css, javascript and 1 or 2 libraries to choose) - after gaining some skills and understanding of web, frontend, how to build it; it is a great exercise to transform boring pdf into resume static page. Especially when there are graphic design skills behind. -- IN PROGRESS --
* simplified message chat - (to choose if the same stack as above or use angular) - while writing messages with many people it is easy to mistake and send message to wrong person. Why not allow user to assign colours to chats windows for easier recognition who is who?
* serverless dice roller - (java, gradle, serverless framework) - in rpg games dices play very important role; they have different dot ranges, different rules when rolled maximum/minimum values; it makes them perfect to apply knowledge of aws cloud services.
* internationalization conversion - (node.js, angular, java, spring, hibernate, postgresql) - i14n and l10n way of parsing strings, generate parsed messages
* github api to display user, repositorys' technologies and their percentage statistics, issues, activity - () - exercise on how to use api's serverd from various sites to make my own toy program :)
